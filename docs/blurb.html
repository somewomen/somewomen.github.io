  <h1>What People are Saying</h1>
  <ul class="blurb">
    
    <li class="blurb"> There were so many beautiful, heartfelt moments that moved everyone in the audience. More people need to see the film!

      <br> — <small><strong>Boo Junfeng, filmmaker</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> Because this is what true gracious storytelling is about - opens a door into someone&#39;s world, invites you to see through their eyes, to sit with them through the good and the bad and everything in between that makes us human - it&#39;s a privilege.

      <br> — <small><strong>Jasmine Ng, filmmaker</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> It’s very rare when after watching a movie, one does not know how to respond. The mind was a flurry of thoughts, emotions, struggles, anguish but all of it with a sense of rejoice for who I saw on the screen.

      <br> — <small><strong>audience member</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> As Singapore’s first trans documentary, “Some Women” is beyond groundbreaking … (a) new queer documentary, for a new age … we learn of Quen’s own biography and also of the mythos and history of trans existence in Singapore.

      <br> — <small><strong>Cab, writer</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> I saw your film today and thought to drop you a message to tell you how much it moved me and, at the same time, educated me … this echoes so deep within me.

      <br> — <small><strong>audience member</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> As a trans woman in a straight-identifying relationship, this doc does hit very close to home. And knowing that I’m not alone in my experience really warms my heart.

      <br> — <small><strong>audience member</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> A film that&#39;s actually life and love itself. I was very touched watching it.

      <br> — <small><strong>Kirsten Tan, filmmaker</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> A beautiful tribute to trans life. I cried six times watching the film.

      <br> — <small><strong>Amanda Lee Koe, writer</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> “Some Women” shows us, in the most articulate and graceful way, one person’s journey to be their authentic self … and she has given us open access to her heart and soul.

      <br> — <small><strong>Li Lin Wee, filmmaker</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> It was so authentic and heartfelt, truly appreciated it. I always thought of myself as being open-minded but this doc made me look at the world, at our country, in a different way.

      <br> — <small><strong>audience member</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> I made it a point to watch it with a friend who’s a staunch Muslim … we really appreciate how you were so generous in sharing the details of intimacy and vulnerability through words and depictions of your life - it made me laugh and tear up.

      <br> — <small><strong>audience member</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> I hope that you’ll give the film a watch if you’re a trans person, or in a relationship with someone who is transgender, as it really brings up a lot of talking points about the issues faced by trans people … Thank you for sharing your experience and, in turn, providing a voice for some of us in a world where many of us choose to remain silent.

      <br> — <small><strong>audience member</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> But at the heart of it - and this is perhaps why it won the Audience Choice Award at 2021&#39;s Singapore International Film Festival - is the moving autobiographical portrait of filmmaker Quen Wong.

      <br> — <small><strong>Straits Times Life!</strong></small>

      
    <li class="blurb"> In SGIFF’s Audience Choice winner, “Some Women”, walk in the shoes of transgender Quen Wong, as she turns the camera onto herself and recounts her long journey to a happier and safer space … I highly recommend the documentary, please catch it when it comes your way.

      <br> — <small><strong>Tan Pin Pin, filmmaker</strong></small>
