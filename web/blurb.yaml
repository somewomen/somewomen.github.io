    Because this is what true gracious storytelling is about - opens a
    door into someone's world, invites you to see through their eyes,
    to sit with them through the good and the bad and everything in
    between that makes us human - it's a privilege.

    It’s very rare when after watching a movie, one does not know how
    to respond. The mind was a flurry of thoughts, emotions, struggles,
    anguish but all of it with a sense of rejoice for who I saw on the
    screen.

    I hope that you’ll give the film a watch if you’re a trans person, or in a relationship with someone who is transgender, as it really brings up a lot of talking points about the issues faced by trans people … Thank you for sharing your experience and, in turn, providing a voice for some of us in a world where many of us choose to remain silent.

    But at the heart of it - and this is perhaps why it won
    the Audience Choice Award at 2021's Singapore International Film
    Festival - is the moving autobiographical portrait of filmmaker
    Quen Wong.

    In SGIFF’s Audience Choice winner, “Some Women”, walk in the shoes
